# FixErrorHelper 

FixErrorHelper is a plugin specifically developed for Eclipse with the aim of simplifying the understanding of console messages related to Java errors or exceptions. The plugin should clearly and concisely provide the cause of the problem, the specific error, and possible solutions. Based on the established return pattern, FixErrorHelper aims to help developers identify and resolve issues more efficiently.
